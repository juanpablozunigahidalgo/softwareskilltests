Hello!

Here is my answer for the test. I will apply such answer into the Software Skills console. 

In any case. This is a dual cycle for code to test and buy and sell. 

It can not buy and sell in the same day. The buy day should be before the selling day.

It can process a random array of integers.


Thanks Lillian!
